# Prime-Number-Finder-Timer
A square root primality test algorithm optimized for speed and implemented in C# aimed to check CPU speed.

## INFO
1. A simple tool developed to be used by non-technical users aiming to check & compare CPU speed.
2. Basic algorithm functionality is implemented and compiled in C# as it is a commonly used language and produces very small standalone executables for Windows compared to other compilers. Tested with .NET Framework v4.

## COMPILE
1. Manually add a reference to System.Management in order to compile.

## TODO
1. Add more algorithms
