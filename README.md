# Prime-Number-Finder-Timer
A trial division primality test algorithm implemented in Python and Autoit aimed to check CPU speed.

#INFO
A simple tool developed to be used by non-technical users aiming to check & compare CPU speed.

Basic algorithm functionality is implemented in Python as it's a popular very high level programming language.
The compiled version was developed with Autoit v3 as it produces very small standalone executables for Windows.

#TODO
Compile in C++
