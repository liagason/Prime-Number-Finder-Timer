# Prime-Number-Finder-Timer
A trial division primality test algorithm implemented in C# aimed to check CPU speed.

## INFO
1. A simple tool developed to be used by non-technical users aiming to check & compare CPU speed.

2. Basic algorithm functionality is implemented and compiled in C# as it is a commonly used language and produces very small standalone executables for Windows compared to other compilers. Tested with .NET Framework v4.

3. Manually add a reference to System.Management in order to compile.

## DOWNLOAD
1. [Download v.1.1.0.3 for Windows x86](https://github.com/liagason/Prime-Number-Finder-Timer/blob/master/pnft.exe "Prime Number Finder Timer x86")
2. [Download v.1.1.0.3 for Windows x64](https://github.com/liagason/Prime-Number-Finder-Timer/blob/master/pnft_x64.exe "Prime Number Finder Timer x64")

## TODO
1. Compile in C++
2. Add more algorithms
