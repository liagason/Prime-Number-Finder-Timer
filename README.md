# Prime-Number-Finder-Timer
A trial division primality test algorithm implemented in Python and Autoit aimed to check CPU speed.

## INFO
1. A simple tool developed to be used by non-technical users aiming to check & compare CPU speed.

2. Basic algorithm functionality is implemented in Python.
The compiled version was developed with Autoit v3 as it produces very small standalone executables for Windows compared to Python compilers.
